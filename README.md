# sim_to_kml
Python script to convert flight sim data to KML format similar to BlackBox flightlogger

The project is now under heavy development. Features will be documented close to release. Currently, the script can already view aircraft trajectory in 3D. However, output needs optimization. Colors and pins are not yet activated but exist in the code.
